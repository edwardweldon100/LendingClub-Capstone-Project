**Project:** 
2 studies (with EDA & Modeling) to gauge what to look for when assessing default risk in unsecured personal loans.  

First, Accepted and Rejected applications were compared to determine which criteria Lending Club used when screening applicants.

Then, Issued and Completed loans were analyzed to understand which loans ultimately paid off and why.
